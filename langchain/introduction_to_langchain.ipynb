      "Based on the provided details, the estimated average price for a house in Tel Aviv measuring approximately 100 square meters with three rooms and located on or below the third floor typically ranges between ₪3.5 million to ₪4.5 million. Tel Aviv is known for its high real estate prices due to its status as a major economic and cultural hub, limited land availability, and high demand for residential properties. The size of 100 square meters is considered a comfortable, medium-sized apartment, which is highly sought after in the city.\n",

Once a block is created, it is added to the chain and cannot be changed. This makes it very secure and reliable. The information on the blockchain is stored on many different computers, so it is decentralized and cannot be controlled by one person or entity. This technology is commonly used for recording and tracking transactions, like buying and selling cryptocurrencies, but it can also be used for other types of data storage and sharing.\n",

It involves feeding large amounts of data into a computer and using algorithms to analyze and find patterns within the data. The computer then uses these patterns to make predictions or decisions about new data it receives. It is like teaching a child how to ride a bike - at first, you show them how to do it, but eventually, they learn on their own and can ride without your help. Similarly, machine learning algorithms learn from the data they are given and improve over time, making them useful for tasks like predicting stock prices, recognizing faces in photos, and even diagnosing diseases.\n",

This allows you to use and store data on the cloud without needing to have physical hardware or infrastructure. It is like renting storage space or using software on someone else's computer, but you can access it from anywhere as long as you have an internet connection. This makes it easier and more convenient to use technology without having to worry about maintenance, updates, or storage space on your own device.\n"
